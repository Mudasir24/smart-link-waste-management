  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
  <p>We believe that clean streets are a basic right, not a luxury. Our mission is to create garbage-free neighborhoods by enabling citizens to report waste in public areas and holding municipal services accountable for timely clean-up.</p>

  <h2>What We Do:</h2>
  <p>This platform allows citizens to easily upload photos of garbage-filled streets, which are then reviewed by our AI system. If garbage is detected, a cleaning request is automatically forwarded to the local municipality. After cleanup, a follow-up image is uploaded and verified by AI to ensure the job was completed.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters:</h2>
  <p>Unclean streets aren’t just an eyesore — they contribute to health hazards, pollution, and community neglect. With your help, we’re using technology to make a real difference, one street at a time.</p>

  <h2>How It Works:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Citizens report by uploading a photo with location.</li>
    <li>AI confirms presence of garbage → ticket is created.</li>
    <li>Municipality is notified and cleans the area.</li>
    <li>Cleanup photo is uploaded and verified.</li>
    <li>Ticket is closed and visible on the public dashboard.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>Whether you're a concerned citizen or a municipal partner, your participation brings us closer to cleaner, healthier communities.</p>
