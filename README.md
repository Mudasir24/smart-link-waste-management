# Smart Link â€” Waste Management Alert System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**Smart Link** is an intelligent waste management and civic monitoring system that empowers **citizens** to report garbage issues and helps **municipal officers** resolve them faster and more reliably.  

The system integrates **Flask**, **YOLOv8**, and multiple **AWS services** to provide a seamless workflow:
- Citizens report issues with images + auto-location detection.
- YOLOv8 verifies trash presence in uploaded photos.
- Officers receive complaints on a dashboard, can navigate to sites, and validate cleanup.
- Notifications (SMS & Email) keep citizens updated at each stage.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
Indiaâ€™s rapidly urbanizing cities face challenges in civic cleanliness. Traditional reporting systems are inefficient and lack verification. Citizens often report, but:
- Officers cannot validate on-site visits.
- No real feedback loop exists for citizens.
- Complaints are unstructured and prone to delays.

**Smart Link** solves these by introducing:
- **AI-powered trash detection (YOLOv8)**.
- **Location verification (AWS Location Service + GPS)**.
- **Automated notifications (AWS SNS)**.
- **Gamified officer dashboard** for accountability.
